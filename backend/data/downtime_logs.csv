Performed an iai reset via the HMI and removed the failed part. Was able to test a few parts without issue but the operator had another fail and the same E-stop error. Noticed they were hitting the finger switch with their palm causing their finger tips to break the light curtain simultaneously. Since the finger switch causes the iai to move home when pressed, the light curtain being blocked causes an E-stop situation. Asked operator and TMS to be aware of hand position when pressing the finger switch and resumed production. Also informed TMS that the iai reset function should clear up the error without having to restart the HMI. <br>                     <b>Notes:</b>&nbsp;Spoke to mechanical team about getting a new bracket made to relocate the finger switch.

Two causes for this: First the coax cable was pulling the probe slightly to the side. Second there was almost no clearance between the probe and the gold part. This was an issue because the probe goes into a sleeve that has a rubber gasket on it and that sits inside another sleeve. If the gasket kept the coax from retracting all the way up it would the barely hit the part when the main part was pulled forward. This would cause the gold part to not sit properly in its slot. I adjusted the air cylinder height just enough to clear the part if the rubber gasket held the coax down slightly.
