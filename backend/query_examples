### Category 1: Specific Log Retrieval
*(These queries test the `AgentRetrieval` spoke, using both metadata and hybrid filters.)*

* "Show me all downtime events that were longer than 45 minutes."
* "How much downtime did we have yesterday across all lines?"
* "Find all logs from July 25th between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM."

### Category 2: Trend & Pattern Analysis
*(These queries test the full `Retrieve` $\rightarrow$ `Analyze` $\rightarrow$ `Synthesize` flow, requiring the `AnalysisAgent` to perform clustering and aggregation.)*

* "What was the single biggest cause of downtime last month?"
* "Which line had the most downtime this quarter?"
* "Are 'pogo pin' issues getting more or less frequent?"
* "Give me a summary of downtime patterns for last week."

### Category 3: Solution & "Fix" Finding
*(These queries test the *semantic search* capability of the `AgentRetrieval` spoke, focusing on the content of the `Notes`.)*

* "Find logs where a 'stuck pin' issue was resolved."
* "Search for any notes that mention 'reseated the fixture' and what the result was."
* "Are there any successful workarounds for 'motor control errors'?"
